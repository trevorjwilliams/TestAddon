# TestAddon

The goal here is to automate as much of the learning of transmog items across all of your characters as possible.  However, there are many, many things I'll need to learn before this goal is practicable.

Toward these ends, I have a series of proof-of-concepts I'd like to implement to take me in the direction of this ultimate goal:

# Steal liberally from TransmogCleanup.
# Print a message to the console.
# Send a letter.
# Send an item in the mail.
# Dump data pulled from MogIt.
# Dump data pulled from TradeSkillMaster.
# Set a variable that persists across sessions.
# Equip an item.
# Sell an item.
